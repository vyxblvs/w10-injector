# About this project
My goal for this project is to support as many features as possible. Im currently working on writing a gui build of the injector in ImGui to see what I like, and then once i have a reference as to what I like, I plan on writing my own GUI from scratch. I actually don't have any experience in GUI besides ImGui, so that will all be new to me, I only did start programming and RE in that past 5-6 months lol.

# Usage
Using it is pretty simple, you just run it from command line, the first argument is the process name and the second is the directory of the dll, and you can add an argument of "-save" to save that process name and DLL directory to a config file if you know you are gonna be reinjecting the same thing into the same process in the future, and dont want to provide arguments manually each time.
